I want to do some sort of YouTube clone, using PHP. It is not meant to be used, it's meant to be a physical manifestation of the coding lessons I will take over the school 
year. I will use the time in class to take coding lessons and to actually make the site.

pretty much a youtube clone

I have no idea how long it will take. Months? (Note that the learning how to make the website will take longer than making it)

user story: 
I want to upload videos so my friends can see, and YouTube, Dailymotion, Vimeo, etc is t̶o̶o̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶v̶e̶n̶i̶e̶n̶t̶ is a goverment run program to capture the lives of everyone and sell their 
data to terrorists, so I want a website that will deliver the general features of a video sharing website - anonymous user

I want to check out videos related to Music, so I used this website's 'Music' category to see popular music - musicfan123

I'm very bitter and negative, so I want to downvote every single thing I see, because of the emptiness in my heart, and this is perfect - ihatepuppies
